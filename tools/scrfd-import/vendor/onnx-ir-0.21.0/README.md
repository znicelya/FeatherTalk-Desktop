# ONNX-IR

Part of the [burn-onnx](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-onnx) project.

ONNX-IR is a pure Rust library for parsing ONNX models into an intermediate representation (IR) that
can be used to generate code for various ML/DL frameworks. It's a core component of the Burn model
import system, providing a clean abstraction layer between ONNX protobuf structures and Burn's
tensor operations.

## Overview

ONNX-IR converts ONNX protobuf models into a clean intermediate representation through a 5-phase
pipeline. The resulting IR provides:

- **Enum-based node representation**: Each node is a variant of the `Node` enum with
  operation-specific configuration
- **Typed inputs/outputs**: All node arguments are validated with type information
- **Pre-extracted configuration**: Attributes are parsed into strongly-typed config structs
- **Static tensor data**: Constant values are available for constant folding
- **Support for 100+ ONNX operators**: Including control flow (`If`, `Loop`, `Scan`)

For detailed architecture information, see the
[Development Guide](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-onnx/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md).

## Usage

ONNX-IR is typically used through the `burn-onnx` crate, but can also be used standalone:

```rust
use onnx_ir::{OnnxGraphBuilder, OnnxGraph, Node};

// Parse an ONNX model from file (uses mmap when available)
let graph: OnnxGraph = OnnxGraphBuilder::new()
    .parse_file("path/to/model.onnx")?;

// Or parse from bytes
let graph = OnnxGraphBuilder::new().parse_bytes(&model_bytes)?;

// Work with the IR - nodes are represented as an enum
for node in &graph.nodes {
    println!("Node: {}", node.name());

    // Pattern match on node type to access operation-specific configuration
    match node {
        Node::Softmax(softmax_node) => {
            println!("  Softmax on axis {}", softmax_node.config.axis);
        }
        Node::Conv2d(conv_node) => {
            println!("  Conv2d with kernel size {:?}", conv_node.config.kernel_size);
        }
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

## Memory-Mapped Loading

By default, ONNX-IR uses memory-mapped file I/O (mmap) when loading models from files. This
provides:

- **Reduced memory usage**: Tensor data is read directly from the file on demand
- **Faster startup**: No need to copy the entire file into memory upfront
- **Lazy loading**: Data is only copied when actually accessed

The `mmap` feature is enabled by default. To disable it:

```toml
[dependencies]
onnx-ir = { version = "...", default-features = false }
```

## ONNX Compatibility

This library supports **all ONNX opset versions** (1 through 24) for every supported operator. Each
operator handles its full version history, including attribute-to-input migrations and
opset-dependent defaults. The opset compliance test suite verifies 461 operator-version combinations.
